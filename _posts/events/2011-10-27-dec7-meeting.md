Presented by Rik Dryfoos, Product Owner with GE Healthcare

Software Craftsmanship has been called "The Fifth Agile Value." The vocabulary of the craftsmanship movement allows us to discuss the quality of *how* code is written along with more familiar performance-based notions of quality. The concepts embodied in craftsmanship lead us toward more maintainable code that has a lower cost of ownership in the long term. Dryfoos will introduce software craftsmanship and discuss how and why it might be wisely embraced by developers and their customers.

Dryfoos began his IT career at Ben & Jerry's. He pioneered the use of new media becoming one of the first end users of Apple's QuickTime and building presentations, trainings and web-based games. He moved on through jobs in Vermont as a developer, a web development manger and a partner at Montpelier's Bear Code - a software development firm where he began to explore agile methodologies. After a stint in New York where he was the Engineering Manager on a team practicing eXtreme Programming and actively pursuing the notion of Software Craftsmanship, Dryfoos returned to Vermont in 2010 to accept a position as Product Owner with GE Healthcare.
