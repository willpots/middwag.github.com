Please join us on July 20th, 2011 from 6:30 - 8:30 pm at
[Three West Collective](http://www.threewestcollective.com/#about) for a presentation and discussion on building CouchApps. 

CouchApps are web applications built using CouchDB, JavaScript, and HTML5. CouchDB is a document-oriented database that stores JSON documents, has a RESTful HTTP API, and is queried using map/reduce views. This talk will answer your basic questions about CouchDB, but will focus on building CouchApps and related tools such as: couchapp, a command line tool used to generate code templates and push CouchApps to CouchDB instances; Evently, a jQuery library used for writing JavaScript applications; CouchDB API, a jQuery library that abstracts access to CouchDBâ€™s core API; CouchApp Loader, used to load design document classes into JavaScript applications; Pathbinder, a JavaScript framework that triggers events based on URL hashes; and Mustache, a JavaScript templating framework.

Bradley Holt is a web developer, entrepreneur, community facilitator, and an author. He is the co-founder of Found Line, a Vermont-based creative studio with capabilities in web development, graphic design, and marketing strategy. He is a Board Member at Vermont Community Access Media, a non-profit community media and technology center.
