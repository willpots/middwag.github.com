Please join us for a lightning talk round of presentations.  

This will be an exciting event with multiple Vermont Software-as-a-Service related companies presenting back-to-back lightning talks about their Web App, technologies used, scaling, and biggest lessons.  

Each company gets less than 10 minutes, followed by a group question & answer period when all presentations are completed.  

Company presentations include:

* [Dealer.com](http://dealer.com) 
* [DrakerLabs.com](http://drakerlabs.com) 
* [MicroStrain.com](http://microstrain.com) 
* [AgilionApps.com](http://AgilionApps.com) 
* [PIEmatrix.com](http://Piematrix.com) 


We will also be presenting the results of the [latest BTVWAG survey](https://docs.google.com/a/agilionapps.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGxaUDVKWWptNURqYVJJYXk0VHJlTmc6MQ).
